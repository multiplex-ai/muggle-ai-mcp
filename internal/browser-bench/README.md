# browser-bench

Internal harness that measures the browser agent against
[WebVoyager](https://github.com/MinorJerry/WebVoyager) — 643 open-web tasks over
15 live sites. It runs one studio process per task, judges the trajectory, and
renders a batch report. Studio's own `studioStatus` is recorded for diagnosis but
never scores the run — the outcome comes from the judge reading the final answer
against the screenshots.

## Running

```
tsx internal/browser-bench/src/run.ts [flags]
```

| Flag | Default | Meaning |
| :--- | :------ | :------ |
| `--tasks <path>` | `data/webvoyager-smoke.jsonl` | WebVoyager JSONL to run |
| `--limit <n>` | whole file | Run only the first `n` tasks |
| `--concurrency <n>` | `2` | Parallel studio processes |
| `--out <dir>` | `reports/` | Where trajectories, profiles, and the report land |
| `--resume` | off | Skip tasks already recorded in `<out>/partial.jsonl` |
| `--max-steps <n>` | `15` | Steps an agent may take per task |
| `--sample-size <n>` | whole file | Draw a site-stratified sample of `n` tasks |
| `--sample-seed <n>` | — | Seed for that draw; required with `--sample-size` |

Raising `--max-steps` above WebVoyager's cap of 15 makes the score
incomparable to published WebVoyager results, so the report says so in its
header whenever it is raised.

Concurrency is memory-bound: every task is a full Electron instance, so raising
it past what the machine's RAM allows makes tasks fail for reasons the benchmark
should not be measuring.

### Output tree

```
<out>/
  partial.jsonl              # one result per line, appended as it lands
  report.md                  # rendered at the end of the batch
  trajectories/<taskId>/     # task.json, result.json, studio's own artifacts
  profiles/<taskId>/         # fresh browser profile, emptied before each task
```

Without `--resume` an existing `partial.jsonl` is deleted, so a rerun never
merges into a previous batch. With `--resume` the tasks already in it are
skipped and its results are folded back into the report in task-file order.

## Studio spawn contract

The harness spawns one process per task:

```
<studio-binary> --benchmark-task <path/to/task.json>
```

The harness writes `task.json`:

```json
{
  "taskId": "Allrecipes--0",
  "instruction": "Provide a recipe for vegetarian lasagna…",
  "startUrl": "https://www.allrecipes.com/",
  "maxSteps": 15,
  "trajectoryDir": "<out>/trajectories/Allrecipes--0",
  "outputFilePath": "<out>/trajectories/Allrecipes--0/result.json"
}
```

Where the result goes travels in the task rather than as a second flag: it is
part of the task, and neither could ever be passed without the other. Studio
rejects a task file missing any of these fields.

Studio writes `result.json`:

```json
{
  "taskId": "Allrecipes--0",
  "finalAnswer": "…",
  "studioStatus": "success",
  "stepCount": 7,
  "durationMs": 41230,
  "trajectoryDir": "<out>/trajectories/Allrecipes--0"
}
```

Exit 0 means the attempt completed — `studioStatus: "success"` scores a pass,
any other status a fail. A non-zero exit, a missing or unreadable result file,
or outliving `TASK_TIMEOUT_MS` (10 minutes) kills the process and records an
infrastructure error instead, which is excluded from the pass-rate denominator.

`tokensUsed` carries studio's reported spend for the attempt, so a score is
always reportable next to what it cost. A build that predates token reporting
omits the field and records `0` rather than failing the parse.

### Environment

| Variable | Default | Meaning |
| :--- | :------ | :------ |
| `MUGGLE_STUDIO_BIN` | `muggle-studio` on `PATH` | The studio binary to spawn |

Set `MUGGLE_STUDIO_BIN` to a local build; the default resolves on `PATH` because
a machine-specific path must never be committed.

Per-task browser isolation needs nothing from the harness: studio's benchmark
mode sets `freshSession` itself, clearing cookies and local storage when the
webview attaches. Isolation is a property of benchmark mode rather than
something a caller can forget to pass.

## Task data

`data/webvoyager-smoke.jsonl` holds 20 tasks copied verbatim from upstream's
`data/WebVoyager_data.jsonl` (MIT): the first task of each of the 15 sites, plus
a second from the first five. It is deliberately small — the full 643 tasks are
upstream's to publish and version, vendoring them here would fork a dataset this
repo does not own, and a smoke slice is what a code change needs to prove the
harness still drives studio end to end. Breadth over volume: every site's page
structure is exercised, none of them deeply.

Fetch the full set when running a real measurement:

```
curl -L -o /tmp/WebVoyager_data.jsonl \
  https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MinorJerry/WebVoyager/main/data/WebVoyager_data.jsonl
tsx internal/browser-bench/src/run.ts --tasks /tmp/WebVoyager_data.jsonl --out /tmp/wv-full
```

### Reproducible slices

The full 643 tasks take a long time and a lot of tokens, so a measurement
usually runs a sample. Draw it by seed rather than by hand:

```
tsx internal/browser-bench/src/run.ts   --tasks /tmp/WebVoyager_data.jsonl --sample-size 100 --sample-seed 20260906
```

Each site keeps its share of the sample, so the slice exercises the same breadth
of page structures as the full set. The draw depends on the seed alone, so
quoting the seed is enough for anyone to rebuild the exact task list a score was
measured on — no slice file to pass around, and nothing to drift.

WebVoyager tasks run against the live web, so some are unanswerable on any given
day — a site redesign, a paywall, or a deleted page. Published WebVoyager scores
carry the same caveat.
